# jQuery Same Height 

This jQuery plugin is built to adjust the height of div elements in order to make them all the same height.

## How to use

Let's say we have three divs like this

    <div class="my_box">...</div>
    <div class="my_box">...</div>
    <div class="my_box">...</div>
    
To make them the same height we can use just this

    $('.my_box').sameHeight();
    
Now all boxes should have the same height.
